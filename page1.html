        <h2 style="color: #000000;">The Ian Robb Situation </h2>
        <p>Ian rob was a player who made top 8 at the most recent Pokemon World Championship. After a win agaisnt a Iron Thorns deck, he did a "hand motion" that was seen by the judges as phallic. Instead of giving him  penalty in the next game, or even him taking a game loss next turn, they overturned the results of the mathc, retconning the win. This made no sense as Ian had already won, and the gesture was ovously not made in bad faith.   </p>
